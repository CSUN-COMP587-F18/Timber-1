Notes Week1:
Modified Gradle to work in environment
Familiarized myself with various different fuctions of app
- Activities are split enough to be tested individually
- Label where every fuction is in the app
- Refactoring needs to be done on some activities in order to test faster
Notes Week2:
Reviewed the and documented the various activities of the app
- Added MD files to easily keep track of what I think still should get tested in the main activities and other areas of the project
- Junit can be used to test android app functionality
    > Mockito can be used to test with specific android calls
    > Espresso can be used to generate tests for the UI

NOTES week3:
- Tests written for search function to get used to using junit with Android
    > Most of the files require android services to test and run so I had to add all dependencies into
    the gradle
    > Having trouble building the tests, need to get test running on actual emulator or phone with the files for search test
- Looked more into the expected results for different methods which have a lot of dependencies

NOTES week4:
- Added tests to TimberUtil and trying to understand how the different values are set and fed into these functions

NOTES week5:
- Created test to get lyrics from the audio files, different types of audio formats store lyrics differently
    > Created 3 sample files with blank audio and edited tags to have the lyrics that match the
      assert expectations
    > Test internet retrieval of lyrics next
    > Espresso can be used to generate tests for the UI
