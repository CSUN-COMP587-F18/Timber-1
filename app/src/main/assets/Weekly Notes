Notes Week1:
Modified Gradle to work in environment
Familiarized myself with various different fuctions of app
- Activities are split enough to be tested individually
- Label where every fuction is in the app
- Refactoring needs to be done on some activities in order to test faster

Notes Week2:
Reviewed the and documented the various activities of the app
- Added MD files to easily keep track of what I think still should get tested in the main activities and other areas of the project
- Junit can be used to test android app functionality
    > Mockito can be used to test with specific android calls
    > Espresso can be used to generate tests for the UI
